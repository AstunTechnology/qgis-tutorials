"QGIS has a powerful programming interface that allows you to extend the core"
" functionality of the software as well as write scripts to automate your "
"tasks. QGIS supports the popular Python scripting language. Even if you are "
"a beginner, learning a little bit of Python and QGIS programming interface "
"will allow you to be much more productive in your work. This tutorial "
"assumes no prior programming knowledge and is intended to give an "
"introduction to python scripting in QGIS (PyQGIS)."
