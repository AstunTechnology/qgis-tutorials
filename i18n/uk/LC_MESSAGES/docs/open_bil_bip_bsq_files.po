"When dealing with remote sensing and scientific datasets, one often comes "
"across data in formats like **BIL**, **BIP** or **BSQ**. `The GDAL library "
"<http://www.gdal.org>`_ - which is used by QGIS to read raster files - has "
"support for these formats, but it cannot open these files by itself. We will"
" go through the process of creating support files so these formats can be "
"read by QGIS."

"Typically, these files are accompanies by a ``.hdr`` file. If your dataset "
"came with a ``.hdr`` file, make sure the root name of the .bil, .bsq or .bip"
" file and the .hdf files match and they are in the same directory. For "
"example, if the file is called ``image.bil`` , the associated file should be"
" named ``image.hdr`` and present in the same directory as the ``image.bil`` "
"file. Then when you go to :menuselection:`Layer --> Add Raster Layer`, "
"select the ``image.bil`` file and it will open without problems."
