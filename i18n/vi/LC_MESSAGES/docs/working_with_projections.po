"Map projections - or Coordinate Reference System (CRS) - often cause a lot "
"of frustration when working with GIS data.  But proper understanding of the "
"concepts and access to the right tools will make it much easier to deal with"
" projections. In this tutorial, we will explore how projections work in QGIS"
" and learn about tools available for vector and rasters - particularly re-"
"projecting vector and raster data, enabling on-the-fly re-projection and "
"assigning projection to data without projection."
