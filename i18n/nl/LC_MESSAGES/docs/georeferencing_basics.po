"Most GIS projects require georeferencing some raster data. *Georeferencing* "
"is the process of assigning real-world coordinates to each pixel of the "
"raster. Many times these coordinates are obtained by doing field surveys - "
"collecting coordinates with a GPS device for few easily identifiable "
"features in the image or map. In some cases, where you are looking to "
"digitize scanned maps, you can obtain the coordinates from the markings on "
"the map image itself. Using these sample coordinates or GCPs ( Ground "
"Control Points ), the image is warped and made to fit within the chosen "
"coordinate system. In this tutorial I will discuss the concepts, strategies "
"and tools within QGIS to achieve a high accuracy georeferencing."

"1.Georeferencing in QGIS is done via the ‘Georeferencer GDAL’ plugin. This "

"Install Plugins` and enable the :guilabel:`Georeferencer GDAL` plugin in the"
" :guilabel:`Installed` tab. See :doc:`using_plugins` for more details on how"
