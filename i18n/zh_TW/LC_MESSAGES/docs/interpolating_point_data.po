"Interpolation is a commonly used GIS technique to create continuous surface "
"from discrete points. A lot of real world phenomena are continuous - "
"elevations, soils, temperatures etc. If we wanted to model these surfaces "
"for analysis, it is impossible to take measurements throughout the surface. "
"Hence, the field measurements are taken at various points along the surface "
"and the intermediate values are inferred by a process called "
"'interpolation'. In QGIS, interpolation is achieved using the built-in "
"``Interpolation plugin``."
msgstr "GIS 系統常常把離散的點資料以內插法創造連續的面資料。自然界中很多東西都是連續的，像是海拔、土壤、溫度等等，如果我們想要分析這種面資料，是不可能把整個表面全部測量一次的。實際上的做法會是我們˙在野外只取幾個測量點，然後測量點之外的其他地方就靠\\ `內插法`\\ 求得其值。在 QGIS 之中，可以透過內建的 ``內插工具`` 附加元件來執行以上所述的事情。"
