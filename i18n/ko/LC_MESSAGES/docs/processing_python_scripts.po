"One can write standalone pyqgis scripts that can be run via the Python "
"Console in QGIS. You can also adapt your pyqgis scripts so they can be run "
"via the Processing Framework. This has several advantages. First, taking "
"user input and writing output files is far easier as Processing Framework "
"offers standardized user interface for these. Having your script in the "
"Processing Toolbox also allows it to be part of any Processing Model or be "
"run as a Batch job with multiple inputs. This tutorial will show how to "
"write a custom python script that can be part of the Processing Framework in"
" QGIS."
