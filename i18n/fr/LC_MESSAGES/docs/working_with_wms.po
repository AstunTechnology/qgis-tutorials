"Often you need reference data layers for your basemap or to display your "
"results in the context of other datasets. Many organizations publish "
"datasets online that can be readily used in GIS. A popular standard for "
"publishing maps online is called **WMS (Web Map Service)**. This is a better"
" choice for using reference layers as you get access to rich datasets in "
"your GIS without the hassle of downloading or styling the data."

"You will see the layer loaded in the QGIS canvas. You can zoom/pan around "
"just like any other layer. The way WMS service works is that every time you "
"zoom/pan, it sends your viewport coordinates to the server and the server "
"creates an image for that viewport and return it to the client. So there "
"will be some delay before you see the image for the area after you have "
"zoomed in. Also, since the data you see is an image, there is no way to "
"query for attributes like in a regular vector/imagery layer."
