"There are some use cases where you want to find all neighboring polygons of "
"each of the polygons in a layer. With a little python script, we can "
"accomplish this and much more in QGIS. Here is an example script you can use"
" to find all polygons that share boundary with each of the polygons in a "
"layer and also add their names to the attribute table. As an added bonus, "
"the script also sums up an attribute of your choice from all the neighboring"
" polygons."
