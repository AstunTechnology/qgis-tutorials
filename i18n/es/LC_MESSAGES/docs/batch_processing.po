"QGIS 2.0 introduced a new concept called **Processing Framework**. "
"Previously known as **Sextante**, the Processing Framework provides an "
"environment within QGIS to run native and third-party algorithms for "
"processing data. It contains a nice batch processing interface that allows "
"one to execute an algorithm on several layers easily. Batch processing is a "
"useful tool that can save manual effort and help you automate repetitive "
"tasks."
