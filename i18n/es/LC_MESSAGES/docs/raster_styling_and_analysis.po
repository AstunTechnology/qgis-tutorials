"A lot of scientific observations and research produces raster datasets. "
"Rasters are essentially grids of pixels that have a specific value assigned "
"to them. By doing mathematical operations on these values, one can do some "
"interesting analysis. QGIS has some basic analysis capabilities built-in via"
" `Raster Calculator`. In this tutorial, we will explore basics on using "
"`Raster Calculator` and options available for styling rasters."
