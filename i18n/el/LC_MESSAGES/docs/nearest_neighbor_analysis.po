"GIS is very useful in analyzing spatial relationship between features. One "
"such analysis is finding out which features are closest to a given feature. "
"QGIS has a tool called **Distance Matrix** which helps with such analysis. "
"In this tutorial, we will use 2 datasets and find out which points from one "
"layer are closest to which point from the second layer."
