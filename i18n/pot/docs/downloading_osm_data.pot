msgid "Getting high quality data is essential for any GIS task. One great resource for free and openly licensed data is `OpenStreetMap(OSM) <http://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ . The OSM database consits of streets, local data as well as building polygons. Getting access to OSM data in a GIS format is integrated in QGIS. This tutorial explains the process for searching, downloading and using OSM data in QGIS."
