msgid "A lot of scientific observations and research produces raster datasets. Rasters are essentially grids of pixels that have a specific value assigned to them. By doing mathematical operations on these values, one can do some interesting analysis. QGIS has some basic analysis capabilities built-in via `Raster Calculator`. In this tutorial, we will explore basics on using `Raster Calculator` and options available for styling rasters."
