msgid "Often you need reference data layers for your basemap or to display your results in the context of other datasets. Many organizations publish datasets online that can be readily used in GIS. A popular standard for publishing maps online is called **WMS (Web Map Service)**. This is a better choice for using reference layers as you get access to rich datasets in your GIS without the hassle of downloading or styling the data."

msgid "Name your connection. This is not the name of the layer but the name of service which is offering the WMS layer. A single service usually offers multiple layers that can be added to your project. The URL that you need to access a WMS layer is called *GetCapabilities*. When you access a WMS server with this parameter in the URL, it returns a list of layers available along with various metadata. In this case, name the connection as ``MRDATA USGS`` and the GetCapabilities URL as ``http://mrdata.usgs.gov/services/ca?request=getcapabilities&service=WMS&version=1.1.1&``. Click :guilabel:`OK`."

msgid "You will see the layer loaded in the QGIS canvas. You can zoom/pan around just like any other layer. The way WMS service works is that every time you zoom/pan, it sends your viewport coordinates to the server and the server creates an image for that viewport and return it to the client. So there will be some delay before you see the image for the area after you have zoomed in. Also, since the data you see is an image, there is no way to query for attributes like in a regular vector/imagery layer."
