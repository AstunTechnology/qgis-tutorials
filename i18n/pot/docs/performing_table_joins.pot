msgid "Not every dataset you want to use comes as a shapefile, or in a spatial format. Often the data would come as a table or a spreadsheet and you would need to link it with your existing spatial data for use in your analysis. This operation is known as a `Table Join` and this tutorial will cover how to carry out table joins in QGIS."

That is ok except for the `D001` field which contains numbers for the population. Having those imported as text would not allow us to run any mathematical operations on this column. To tell QGIS to import the field as a number, we need to create a `sidecar` file with a `.csvt` extension. This file will have only 1 row specifying data types for each column. Save this file as `ca_tracts_pop.csvt` in the same directory as the original `.csv` file.
