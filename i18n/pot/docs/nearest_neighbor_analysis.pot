msgid "GIS is very useful is analyzing spatial relationship between features. One such analysis is finding out which features are closest to a given feature. QGIS has a tool called **Distance Matrix** which helps with such analysis. In this tutorial, we will use 2 datasets and find out which points from one layer are closest to which point from the second layer."
