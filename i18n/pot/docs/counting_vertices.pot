msgid "QGIS doesnâ€™t have a built-in function to calculate number of vertices for each feature in a layer. But a very handy plugin called **Vertices Counter** fills this gap and adds a few handy features as well."

msgid "By default, the active layer will be selected under the :guilabel:`Layer Selection`. You may select any other loaded layers or open layer directly from disk as well. The plugin has an option called :guilabel:`Create new column` which can add an number of vertices as an attribute for each feature. This is handy for a lot of use cases, so we can select that option. Now click on the :guilabel:`Count Vertices` button and the :guilabel:`Results` section will be populated with vertex count for each feature. You can even see the :guilabel:`Total Vertices` displayed on the side."
