"The power of GIS lies in analysing multiple data sources together. Often the"
" answer you are seeking lies in many different layers and you need to do "
"some analysis to extract and compile this information. One such type of "
"analysis is **Points-in-Polygon**. When you have a polygon layer and a point"
" layer - and want to know how many or which of the points fall within the "
"bounds of each polygon, you can use this method of analysis."
