"Digitizing is one of the most common tasks that a GIS Specialist has to do. "
"Often a large amount of *GIS time* is spent in digitizing raster data to "
"create vector layers that you use in your analysis. Quantum GIS has powerful"
" capabilities to digitize raster data. In this tutorial, we will take some "
"high resolution satellite imagery and digitize it to create a vector polygon"
" layer."

"The task at hand is to digitize all the water bodies from the satellite "

"You will notice that the image seems completely black and without "
