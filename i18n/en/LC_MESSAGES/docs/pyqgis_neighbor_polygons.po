"There are some use cases where you want to find all neighboring polygons of "
"each of the polygons in a layer. With a little python script, we can "
"accomplish this and much more in QGIS. Here is an example script you can use"
" to find all polygons that touch each of the polygons in a layer and also "
"add their names to the attribute table. A user also wanted to sum up the "
"values of a given attribute from all the neighboring polygons, so I added "
"that part to the script as well."

"To demonstrate this, let’s take an example that given a layer of country "
"polygons, you want to find countries that share the border and also what is "
"the total population of the country’s neighbors."

"The script uses 2 fields to perform the action. *name* field and a field "
"that you want to *sum up*. In this case the name field is :guilabel:`NAME` "
"and we want to sum up the population estimates from :guilabel:`POP_EST` "
"field. Open the :file:`neighborys.py` script in a text editor like Notepad "
"and change the field values from your layer."

"The script will take some time to run as it is comparing each polygon "

" have 2 extra attribute fields in your table called ``Neighbors`` and "
"``Sum``."
