"Examine your tabular data source. To import this data to QGIS, you will have"
" to save it as a text file and need at least 2 columns which contain the X "
"and Y coordinates. If you have a spreadsheet, use `Save As` function in your"
" program to save it as a `Tab Delimited File` or a `Comma Separated Values "
"(CSV)` file. Once you have the data exported this way, you can open it in a "
"text editor such as Notepad to view the contents. In case of the Significant"
" Earthquake Database, the data already comes as a text file which contains "
"latitude and longitude of the earthquake centers along with other related "
"attributes. You will see that each field is separated by a TAB."
