"QGIS doesnâ€™t have a built-in function to calculate number of vertices for "
"each feature in a layer. But a very handy plugin called **Vertices Counter**"
" fills this gap and adds a few handy features as well."

"By default, the active layer will be selected under the :guilabel:`Layer "
"Selection`. You may select any other loaded layers or open layer directly "
"from disk as well. The plugin has an option called :guilabel:`Create new "
"column` which can add an number of vertices as an attribute for each "
"feature. This is handy for a lot of use cases, so we can select that option."
" Now click on the :guilabel:`Count Vertices` button and the "
":guilabel:`Results` section will be populated with vertex count for each "
"feature. You can even see the :guilabel:`Total Vertices` displayed on the "
"side."

"As you will notice, a column named *Vertices* will be added at the end with "
