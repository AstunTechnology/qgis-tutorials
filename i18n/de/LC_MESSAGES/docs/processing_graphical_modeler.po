"GIS Workflows typically involve many steps - with each step generating "
"intermediate output that is used by the next step. If you change the input "
"data or want to tweak a parameter, you will need to run through the entire "
"process again manually.  Fortunately, QGIS has a graphical modeler built-in "
"that can help you define your workflow and run it with a single invocation. "
"You can also run these workflows as a batch over a large number of inputs."
