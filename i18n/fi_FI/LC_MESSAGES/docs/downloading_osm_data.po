"Getting high quality data is essential for any GIS task. One great resource "
"for free and openly licensed data is `OpenStreetMap(OSM) "
"<http://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ . The OSM database consits of streets, "
"local data as well as building polygons. Getting access to OSM data in a GIS"
" format is integrated in QGIS. This tutorial explains the process for "
"searching, downloading and using OSM data in QGIS."
